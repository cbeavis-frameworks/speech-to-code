# SpeechToCode - Technical Specification

## Overview
SpeechToCode is a macOS application designed to enable voice-controlled coding and terminal interaction. The application serves as a bridge between natural language input and coding environments, allowing users to control their development workflow through voice commands and AI assistance.

## Core Components

### 1. Terminal Controller
The Terminal Controller provides a bridge between the SpeechToCode app and the macOS Terminal.app, allowing the app to:
- Connect to and control an existing Terminal window
- Send commands to the Terminal
- Read and process Terminal output
- Handle interactive prompts and user choices
- Summarize Terminal activity for easier understanding

#### Key Features:
- **Terminal Connection**: Establishes and maintains a connection to Terminal.app
- **Command Execution**: Sends commands to Terminal with proper keystroke simulation
- **Output Capture**: Continuously polls and captures Terminal output
- **Interactive Mode Detection**: Identifies when Terminal is waiting for user input
- **Keystroke Simulation**: Sends specific keystrokes to respond to prompts (Yes/No/Enter/etc.)
- **Output Summarization**: Condenses Terminal output for easier consumption

### 2. Terminal View
Provides a user interface for interacting with Terminal.app from within the SpeechToCode app:
- Displays Terminal output with auto-scrolling
- Offers command input field for sending commands
- Provides quick-access buttons for common Terminal interactions
- Shows interactive controls when Terminal is in interactive mode
- Displays summarized Terminal activity

### 3. Helper Scripts
- **terminal_helper.sh**: Bash script that handles low-level Terminal interactions using AppleScript
  - Sends commands to Terminal.app
  - Sends keystrokes for interactive prompts
  - Reads Terminal content
  - Checks Terminal status

### 4. Permissions and Security
- Requires Accessibility permissions to control Terminal.app
- Uses AppleScript for Terminal interaction
- Includes proper entitlements for automation

## Technical Implementation

### Terminal Interaction Flow
1. User inputs a command via SpeechToCode interface
2. TerminalController processes the command
3. terminal_helper.sh sends the command to Terminal.app using keystroke simulation
4. TerminalController polls Terminal output to capture the result
5. Output is displayed and optionally summarized in the TerminalView

### Interactive Prompt Handling
1. TerminalController detects patterns indicating an interactive prompt
2. TerminalView displays appropriate interactive controls
3. User selects a response (or AI agent determines appropriate response)
4. TerminalController sends the corresponding keystroke to Terminal.app

### AI Integration Points
- Terminal output analysis for context understanding
- Interactive prompt detection and option extraction
- Decision making for automated responses to prompts
- Command generation based on natural language input

## Future Enhancements
1. **Enhanced Pattern Recognition**: Improve detection of various terminal prompts
2. **AI Decision Making**: Implement AI-based decision making for terminal interactions
3. **Context-Aware Suggestions**: Provide intelligent suggestions based on terminal history
4. **Custom Terminal Profiles**: Support for different terminal configurations
5. **Multi-Window Support**: Control multiple terminal windows simultaneously

## Technical Requirements
- macOS 11.0 or later
- Swift 5.3+
- Terminal.app accessibility permissions
- AppleScript automation permissions
