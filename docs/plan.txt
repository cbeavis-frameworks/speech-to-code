# SpeechToCode Multi-Agent Implementation Plan

## Overview

This implementation plan outlines the steps needed to enhance the SpeechToCode application with a multi-agent architecture that integrates OpenAI's Realtime API and Anthropic's Claude Code CLI. The plan builds upon the existing Terminal Controller feature to create a seamless voice-controlled coding experience with two AI agents:

1. **Conversation Agent**: Handles user interaction, orchestrates workflow, and manages communication with the Terminal/Claude
2. **Planning Agent**: Maintains project context, tracks tasks, and provides long-term memory for the system

## Phase 1: Foundation Setup

### 1.1. Project Configuration 
- [x] Add OpenAI API client dependencies
- [x] Configure API keys and authentication for OpenAI
- [x] Set up environment variables for API access
- [x] Update project entitlements for necessary permissions

### 1.2. Terminal Controller Enhancements 
- [x] Extend TerminalController to support Claude Code CLI-specific commands
- [x] Add detection for Claude Code interactive prompts
- [x] Implement Claude Code command history tracking
- [x] Create specialized response parsing for Claude Code output

### 1.3. AI Agent Models 
- [x] Create RealtimeSession model for managing OpenAI Realtime API sessions
- [x] Implement ConversationAgent model with state management
- [x] Implement PlanningAgent model with persistent storage
- [x] Create AgentMessage model for structured communication

## Phase 2: Voice Processing Integration

The goal of this phase is to add voice processing capabilities to the SpeechToCode application.

### 2.1 Voice Processing Design (COMPLETE)

- Design a `VoiceProcessor` class to handle audio input and output
- Determine the architecture for integrating voice with the existing agent system
- Ensure compatibility with the multi-agent architecture from Phase 1

### 2.2 Voice Processing Implementation (COMPLETE)

- [x] Implement the `VoiceProcessor` class with the following capabilities:
  - [x] Use macOS Speech Recognition framework to convert speech to text locally
  - [x] Provide voice activity detection (VAD) to determine when the user is speaking
  - [x] Manage speech recognition sessions and transcription processing
  - [x] Support text-to-speech for AI responses
  
- [x] Modify the `RealtimeSession` to work with transcribed text rather than raw audio:
  - [x] Remove audio streaming functionality
  - [x] Add methods for processing transcriptions from the VoiceProcessor
  - [x] Ensure proper handler delegation for transcription updates
  
- [x] Update the `ConversationAgent` to manage voice command processing:
  - [x] Add methods for starting and stopping voice listening
  - [x] Implement delegate methods for handling transcription updates
  - [x] Process recognized speech for command execution

- [x] Update the `AgentMessage` model to support voice-related message types:
  - [x] Add voice input message type for transcribed user speech
  - [x] Add voice output message type for AI responses to be spoken

## Phase 3: Planning Agent Implementation

### 3.1. Plan Storage
- [x] Create PlanStorage model for persistent plan data
- [x] Implement file-based or database storage for plans
- [x] Add serialization/deserialization for plan data
- [x] Create backup and recovery mechanisms

### 3.2. Plan Management
- [x] Implement plan creation and initialization
- [x] Add task tracking and status updates
