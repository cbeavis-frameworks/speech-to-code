# SpeechToCode Multi-Agent Implementation Plan

## Overview

This implementation plan outlines the steps needed to enhance the SpeechToCode application with a multi-agent architecture that integrates OpenAI's Realtime API and Anthropic's Claude Code CLI. The plan builds upon the existing Terminal Controller feature to create a seamless voice-controlled coding experience with two AI agents:

1. **Conversation Agent**: Handles user interaction, orchestrates workflow, and manages communication with the Terminal/Claude
2. **Planning Agent**: Maintains project context, tracks tasks, and provides long-term memory for the system

## Technical Implementation Details

### Realtime API Session Management

```swift
class RealtimeSessionManager {
    // Manages WebSocket connections to OpenAI Realtime API
    // Handles session creation, updates, and termination
    // Processes incoming events and routes them appropriately
}
```

### Function Calling Schema

```json
{
  "name": "run_command",
  "description": "Send a command to the Terminal, which may be running the Claude CLI.",
  "parameters": {
    "type": "object",
    "properties": {
      "command": {
        "type": "string",
        "description": "The command text to submit in the Terminal."
      },
      "auto_confirm": {
        "type": "boolean",
        "description": "Whether to automatically confirm common prompts (y/n)."
      }
    },
    "required": ["command"]
  }
}
```

### Agent Communication Flow

1. User speaks a command â†’ Speech recognition converts to text
2. Text sent to Conversation Agent via Realtime API
3. Conversation Agent processes request and may:
   - Query Planning Agent for context
   - Issue terminal commands via function calling
   - Generate direct responses to the user
4. Terminal Controller executes commands in Terminal (with Claude Code)
5. Terminal output is captured and returned to Conversation Agent
6. Conversation Agent decides next steps based on terminal output and plan
7. Agent provides voice and visual feedback to the user

### Data Persistence

- Project plans stored in structured JSON format
- Session history maintained for context continuity
- Terminal command history tracked for reference
- User preferences saved for personalization
